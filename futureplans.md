## This file details future plans/ideas for the site.
------------------------------------------------------
- Remove Broken Games.

- Add More Games.

- Add A Dedicated Site Chatroom.

- Make An Unblocker Section.

- Make The UI/UX Better.

- Make The Site More Optimized By Minimizing/Simplifying The Old Code.

- Make A Dynamic Game Page that loads games based on URL query params (Ex: /game?1v1.lol Or /p?jellytruck)
This would speed up production as pages wouldn't be regenerated.

- Fix Sitemap.

- Get A Custom Domain.

- Make A better readme.md.

- make it so all hyperlinks are highlighted by default and just use a diff class for no highlight.

- Make Daily secret use an api instead of manual commits.

- Move Games/Thumbnails to a seperate repository in order to speed up deploy times.

- Add better changelog (maybe even add a popup for it)
